# Footstep Power Generation âš¡ðŸ‘£

This project converts the mechanical energy from footsteps into electrical energy using piezoelectric sensors.

## ðŸ”§ Components Used
- Piezoelectric sensors
- Bridge rectifier
- Capacitor
- Rechargeable battery
- Load (LED/Bulb)

## ðŸ§  Working
When a person steps on the plate, pressure is applied on the piezo sensors which generate voltage. The output is rectified, stored in a capacitor/battery, and used to power small loads.

## ðŸ’» Code
The microcontroller monitors the generated voltage and displays it.
